Learning Objectives At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General How to use linked lists Start to look for the right source of information without too much help Requirements General Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 All your files should end with a new line A README.md file, at the root of the folder he Betty style. It will be checked using betty-styof the project is mandatory Your code should use tle.pl and betty-doc.pl You are not allowed to use global variables No more than 5 functions per file The only C standard library functions allowed aresh _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden You are allowed to use _putchar You don’t have to puwon’t be taken into account In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t prototypes of all your functions and the prototypehave to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples The of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h Don’t forget to push your header file All your header files should be include guarded
